<title>How my home page was created</title>

  <h2>Wireframe</h2>

  <h2>Fireworks</h2>

  <p>Click <a href="file:///Users/CTD-01/Desktop/Jennifer-WWW/W4-CSS-Challenge-CTD-/CTD-Planning-Site-JBae/htdocs/index-FW.htm">here</a> to view my Fireworks page.</p>

  <h3>Pros</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The slice tool on Fireworks is convenient for inserting links.</li>
    <li>I have more experience with Fireworks than Dreamweaver, so I am more familiar with Fireworks.</li>
    <li>It's a lot easier to utilize the tools and make more shapes besides squares.</li>
    <li>It's much easier to design and create things on fireworks as there are tons of different options and colors and shapes that are at your disposal
    that Dreamworks does not have.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Cons</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You can't use html or css to code things. To design your website, you must use geometric shapes and tools, therefore you can't make a proper, functioning
    website on Fireworks.</li>
    <li>It is ideal for making a wireframe and storyboard, but it is not the best choice for creating a real website.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Dreamweaver</h2>

  <p>Click <a href="file:///Users/CTD-01/Desktop/Jennifer-WWW/W4-CSS-Challenge-CTD-/CTD-Planning-Site-JBae/htdocs/Index-DW.html">here</a> to view my Dreamweaver page.</p>

  <h3>Pros</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You can see what effect you're having on your website while you're working without having to save and open it in your browser.</li>
    <li>You can create a website without using actual code since Dreamweaver does the coding for you.</li>
    <li>The design mode is useful to see how the final product will turn out to look like.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Cons</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I'm not familiar with Dreamweaver since this is the first time I have used it.</li>
    <li>The tools are somewhat difficult to understand and sometimes, I find myself unable to find certain things.</li>
    <li>The shapes seem limited and there aren't as many choices as Fireworks.</li>
    <li>It's very hard to insert pictures into Dreamweaver which I find extremely inconvenient.</li>
  </ul>
