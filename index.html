    <h1>Designing a Photography Website</h1>
      <p>The purpose of this website is to enable people living in mainland China to
          access Helen's grandparents photography website since they only have a Facebook
          page that is rarely updated and is inaccessible to people who live in countries
          where Facebook is blocked.</p>

  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p>It is targetted to people in Hong Kong and/or mainland China who need a professional
      photographer to assist them in taking photos for special occassions eg. funerals,
      weddings, family portraits, etc.</p>

  <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p>We want to be able to construct a website that can attract more potential Hong Kong
      or mainland customers who need photos taken. Using the internet, we can attract more
      viewers and people on google who search for "photography in Hong Kong" will be able
      to find and access this website while also being able to browse through the many
      pictures and hopefully hire the photographer to take pictures for them. Since there
      was no photography site prior to the one we are creating for our client, we must
      work entirely from scratch and develop a website with our skills and knowledge on
      website coding.</p>

    <h3>How can I plan a website? What is the design process for creating websites? What are wireframes, storyboards and prototypes?</h3>
      <p><ul>
        <li>You can plan a website by using flowcharts, wireframes and storyboards to get the basic feel of your website.</li>
        <li>For the designing process, you create a flowchart for the amount of pages that you want to make, then you create a wireframe to plot out where you
          would like things to go. Storyboards are used to flesh out the wireframe and make it an exact copy of your website.</li>
        </ul>

  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
    <p><ul>
      <li>Come up with a URL for the website</li>
      <li>Create the website layout</li>
      <li>Find pictures that are allowed to be displayed on the website.</li>
    </ul></p>

  <h2>Evidence of meeting with the client</h2>
    <p>Since the client is a close relative of Helen's, Helen was able to talk to him
      and ask him about the website over the winter break. We found out that unfortunately,
      most, if not all of his previous clients did not give permission to the photographer
      to use their photos for public usage, so we need to find photographs that can be
      displayed publically.
