  <title>Photography website planning site</title>

    <h1>Designing a Photography Website</h1>
      <p>The purpose of this website is to enable people living in mainland China to
          access Helen's grandparents photography website since they only have a Facebook
          page that is rarely updated and is inaccessible to people who live in countries
          where Facebook is blocked. Our project will be about us designing and creating a photography website for our client.</p>
      <h2>Final Product</h2>
      <a href="http://www.theeaglepages.com/CTD3C/2015/FinalPhotographySite/"> Link</a>

      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p>It is targetted to people in Hong Kong and/or mainland China who need a professional
      photographer to assist them in taking photos for special occassions eg. funerals,
      weddings, family portraits, etc.</p>

  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <p>- Construct a website that people in China can access. √<br />
    - Display the photographer's work. √<br />
  - Develop four different pages. √<br />
  - Introduce the photographer to people who are viewing the website. √
  </p>
<h2>Success Criteria
  
</h2>
    <li>Create a consistent theme that makes the website look like one whole website.</li>
    <li>Use high quality photos</li>
    <li>Provide sufficient information about the website and the company's services</li></p>
    <p><b>How can I plan a website? What is the design process for creating websites? What are wireframes, storyboards and prototypes?</b>    </p>
    <ul>
  <li>You can plan a website by using flowcharts, wireframes and storyboards to get the basic feel of your website.</li>
        <li>For the designing process, you create a flowchart for the amount of pages that you want to make, then you create a wireframe to plot out where you
          would like things to go. Storyboards are used to flesh out the wireframe and is usually the same as your finished product. You use the storyboard as
          a base for your website so that you know how things will look before your website is complete.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Goals</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Choose a common theme for the website to be used on other social media platforms</li>
    <li>Find photos that are able to be displayed in public.</li>
    <li>Create a storyboard</li>
    <li>Successfully combine four subpages to create one whole website.</li>
    <li>Give and receive feedback to improve the website.
      </p>
  </p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Evidence of meeting with the client</h2>
    <p>Since the client is a close relative of Helen's, Helen was able to talk to him and ask him about the website over the winter break.
      We found out that unfortunately, most, if not all of his previous clients did not give permission to the photographer to showcase their photos
      to the public.

</p>
    <h2>Client's Requirements    </h2>
<li>Displays different types of photos</li>
    <li>Mentions what the photography studio is about and who they are</li>
    <li>Showcases the photos in a eye-catching and effective way</li>
  <h2>Flowchart ideas</h2>

  <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Np5GmsY.png" /></p>
  <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/sgdy80k.png" /></p>

  <h2>Chosen flowchart</h2>

  <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/pWjBzhK.png" />

  </p>
  <p>We chose this flowchart because it was the one that we felt would be the most simple and effective flowchart that would be able to reperesent the website well. It's easier to navigate compared to our other flowchart ideas and this one also seems more organized and less cluttered.</p>
  <h2>Subpages</h2>

	<b>Subpages on the website:</b>
	<ul>
	<li>Gallery - slideshow of example pictures</li>
	<li>About us - brief description/history of the company</li>
	<li>Contacts - contact information including the address, email, phone number, etc.</li>
	<li>Other information - FAQ, miscellaneous information</li>
</ul>

	<p>As there are four people in our group and four subpages for our website, we decided to give each person in the team a page to work on. The page that I was
	required to work on was the gallery page. Jaliff was the one who created the template for the subpages.</p>

	<b>Tasks:</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Our purpose is to open up more media information for the client's photography website. We want to give people opportunities to have more ways to contact
			and obtain more information about the client's website. Since this website will be catered to the client's needs, the website will be entirely customizable
			to fit the client's needs and hopefully make it easier for customers to browse and purchase his services.</li>
		<li>Our target audience is towards people who live in the Hong Kong and mainland China area who have tasks that require a photographer's services for
			example, a wedding photo, funeral photo, etc.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Review MAP</h2>

	<h2>Look and Feel</h2>
	<p>Our website has a professional art gallery esque feeling. We wanted to capture the photos and make the website look almost like an authentic photo museum or something along those lines. We played around with the background and the style to get the theme and feel that we wanted. We also wanted to make the website convenient to browse photos with.</p>
        
  <h2>Fireworks vs. Dreamweaver</h2>
        
	<p>In terms of making a wireframe, storyboard and general designing, I definitely find Fireworks a lot easier to work with since I have more experience using it than Dreamweaver. It's also a lot better suited for designing and truly capturing an image than Dreamweaver since Dreamweaver's options in terms of designing are definitely limited in my perspective. Dreamweaver is a lot better to use for a functioning website and for coding things into your website and getting it online.</p>
	<p>I think my preference between Fireworks and Dreamweaver vary depending on what I am trying to accomplish. If I'm just making a wirefreame or storyboard, then I'd rather go with Fireworks. If it's to create the final product, then Dreamweaver is the way to go.</p>
<h2>Template Wireframe</h2>

	<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3eUHroI.png"></p>
  <p>Our template wireframe was created by Jaliff and it was intended for the usage of all the subpages that our website needed. Sometimes the website seemed
		to be a bit restricting since there were times when I wanted to edit the template in order to properly accomodate the content that I was required to insert
		in order to complete the final product for my subpage.</p>

	<h2>Navigation</h2>
	<p>The navigational buttons can be created on Fireworks using the vector and text tools. To create an interactive button on Fireworks, you must first turn the buttons into a symbol on Fireworks.</p>
	<p>From there, you can add more things to your button, such as having them fade when your cursor hovers over the button or you can have them be pushed in when you click the button. Afterwards, you can export the button to Dreamweaver and make an AP div for the buttons. Afterwards, you are able to use the buttons on your planning site.</p>
  <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JPZjndG.png" /></p>
	<p>The shadow affect underneath the buttons can give the buttons a more 3D effect and have it stand out more. This also makes these pictures look more like buttons.</p>
	<h2>Publishing Website through DW</h2>

  <h2>Evaluation</h2>
	<p>It was a bit difficult to work together as a group since there was a great lack of communication between the group members and at one point, we had four
		completely different wireframes and page ideas. In the end, we managed to sort it out and create a new wireframe that everyone could use so that the website
		was more consistent and looked like one whole website instead of a bunch of scattered different websites.
	I think we could definitely improve in communication since our group lacked communication between the members. This confused everyone to the point where it felt like we were working on four different websites instead of just one website with all of our combined efforts.
	<p>- Construct an accessible website for people in mainland China and Hong Kong who want photos taken √<br />
	   - It was a bit difficult at first since it was hard to communicate with the group and put together all of the pages but we managed to overcome that by figuring out the innerworks of github and put all of our pages together.<br />
	   - Display the photographer's pictures √<br />
	   - This one was also a bit of a challenge. I wanted to try and include a slideshow in the gallery page but we could not find any suitable slideshow html codes so the slideshow always came out looking strange or incomplete. We ended up just displaying the photos in a rows and columns.<br />
	   - Develop four different pages √<br />
  - Our four pages are: gallery, contact us, about us and heritage. This was fairly easy to accomplish since there are four people in my group and one person was assigned to work on one subpage.     <br />
  - Introduce the photographer to the people who view the webpage. √    <br />
  - We managed to accomplish this easily through the about me page which we created for this exact purpose.
  <br />
<h2>Fitness for Purpose</h2>
	<p>In regards to our objectives, I think that we were able to complete most of them throughout the website creation process. I managed to ask my group mates for a bit advice as well as some ideas and they provided them for me. We originally wanted to insert a slideshow into the gallery subpage but due to the lack of knowledge and coding skills, we were unable to include the slideshow and simply settled for placing them along the website with a caption for each photograph. We were also able to use photos from the photography studio that were not made private and that we had the rights to use publically. We also managed to accomplish the client's needs by including an about me page to discuss what the studio is about and a gallery where people can browse through the numerous photos on display and get a feel of the photographer's skills before hiring him.</p>
